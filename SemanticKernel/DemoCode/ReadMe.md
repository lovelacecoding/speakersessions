# Notes

## Update Conf
Don't forget to add an appsettings.json file in the root.

For the Copilot demo: I forgot to demo two plugins working together through a planner. You can totally run "List all female crewmates and save it in crew.txt. Add the date too.". That would use all three plugins through one input message.
